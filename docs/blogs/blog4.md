# Lecture 16 - Design That Matters II Critque

I enjoyed Rhea's thoughts on the tension between 'doing good' and 'making money' and how it relates to the Dieselgate scandal. This semester I am taking Ethics for Engineers where we studied this case, specifically looking into the situation from the point of view of Oliver Schmidt, who was the Principal Deputy to the Head of Engine Development at the time of the scandal. After discrepancies were found in the amount of NOx gasses emitted by the Volkswagen engine, higher-ups in Germany were briefed by Schmidt on the situation. The higher-ups all recommended that he returned to the United States to use his influence and continue misleading regulators. 

Despite dissatisfaction from his peers along with Schmidt acknowledging how immoral the company's actions were, he still remained cooperative. I found this to be quite telling about how poor the company's culture was--profits were truly this company's only goal. Rhea made a great point about the importance of organization and structure of companies when it comes to 'doing good'. I believe this scandal could have been prevented if Volkswagen had empowered employees at all levels, rather than only letting executives make decisions. For example, involving employees at all levels in ethics committees could improve ethical decision-making drastically. Furthermore, I believe it is of utmost importance that any company that aims to do any good should promote a work culture which involves speaking up when things do not feel right. All in all, any workplace that forces its workers to act against their morals makes no appeal towards doing any good.
