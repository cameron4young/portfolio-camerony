## Webpage Scanning Patterns On Different Webpages

In class we discussed scanning patterns, which are the ways in which people skim webpages for information. It was mentioned that the most common pattern for English (or any left-to-right language) language readers was the F-shaped pattern, where users scan the page from left to right, scan down the left side of the page, and then repeat this process. I was curious to research more about scanning patterns and figure out during which scenarios these patterns are best to use. The importance in understanding these patterns lie within their ability to help us design easily-scannable webpages, where users can quickly absorb information on a page with ease.

The main factor which contributes to which scanning patterns people use is webpage contents. To be more precise, pages which are more text-heavy most commonly result in people using the F-shaped pattern. Other patterns people use to scan text-heavy websites include spotted pattern, layer cake pattern, and the commitment pattern (not mentioned in class). The motivations for using these patterns are closely linked to the user's intentions and their opinions of the websites (which surprised me!). Nonetheless, F-shaped scanning is the most popular due to it being the most generic/useful in most situations. Below are examples of sites in which F-shaped scanning patterns are most suitable. In my own trials, I found that the places I started scanning horizontally oftentimes were at starts of new paragraphs. This proves the importance of good spacing in our designs.

Another scanning pattern we talked about in class is described by the Nielsen Norman Group as the zigzag pattern. This pattern is most popular when the webpage contents are mainly made up of non-text elements. While both aligned and alternating layouts are able to be scanned using this pattern, the Nielsen Norman Group discovered that non-text elements in an alternating layout are much less likely to be ignored. Considering this, it is important to place elements on these types of pages in an alternating layout. Below is an example of the two layouts from the NNG website, showing that it is easy to skip non-text content when text is aligned to one side.
