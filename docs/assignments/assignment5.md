# Assignment 5

## Heuristic Evaluation
- **Usability criteria:**
  - User profile has + marks, all buttons are spelled out
  - Settings and bookmarks are recognizable icons
  - All features of the app are organized such that main user flows do not intersect, allowing users to quickly accomplish goals
  - perhaps browsing could be easier if there was a hover to play feature on videos?
  - Any purchases on the app are through third party websites, so nothing can be accidentally bought
  - Posts have an edit, however messages don’t, this may be something to improve on. Perhaps just adding deleting it
  - In terms of promotion, users are placed into different user groups by interests rather than advertisers having direct access to profiles
    - The only information taken from users is voluntarily given through an optional user survey
      - users should explicitly be able to remove any information given (along with being able to modify)
  - The interface is pleasing, however some elements could use better spacing.
  - The splitting of user flows in the header makes the application easier to use for people with disabilities (no need to scroll through menus, etc.)
  - User profile survey may not be accessible for people with visual disabilities
  - Up and down list would be much better

- **Physical heuristics:**
  - Video elements are grouped closely together allowing for them to be reached quickly while browsing
  - Header and side header buttons are big and obvious
  - Elements should display ‘loading’ if there are time delays
  - Layout conveys conceptual structure, the videos are all grouped together. On the feed page, all of the categories are grouped together. also, the user flows are positioned towards the bottom of the screen to allow for scrolling
  - Buttons on the header can be accessed on any page to allow the users to quickly switch actions
  - Buttons are highlighted when a user presses them. example: browse is highlighted when users are on the browse page
  - Same with conversations and feed categories
  - A shortcut to send offers directly from the conversation page would be useful
    - More shortcuts may make the app harder to use for the targeted audience (older people)
