## **Interview #1 Report**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley is a 47 year old man whose social media platform of choice is Facebook, which he uses for both work and entertainment. As a car salesman, he leverages personal connections and regularly uploads videos of cars at his dealership to increase sales. Wesley’s experience on Facebook as both a content viewer and creator provides interesting insight into how advertising and ‘product searching’ on social media could potentially be revolutionized to empower both buyers and sellers. When talking about why Facebook in particular is useful to his job, he says “Not only do I get to show off the cars I’m selling, but \[Facebook’s\] also a really great tool to keep in contact with people from the past. It really broadens my scope of who I can sell cars to—people would much rather buy from the guy they went to high school with than some other random guy that might be a bit closer”. Although he views Facebook as a great tool to promote products, he does not have trust in the algorithms or paid promotions—he sees Facebook more as a way to connect with people he already knows rather than reaching a wider audience. I suggest this may prove the importance of creating a platform where advertising is more accessible and transparent for people of all backgrounds. Additionally, he feels that “the fact that he’s not an influencer severely limits his reach”, despite how many hashtags he puts on his posts. A huge takeaway from this is that if platforms wish to empower their advertisers and make finding useful products easier, they should democratize advertisement abilities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley also provides interesting insight into his experience as a content viewer. His favorite part of Facebook is the fact that everything on there is “in the now”. He feels that the content he sees is very relevant, including the advertisements he sees. In particular he recounted a story about how he continuously was recommended videos on shilajit, which eventually led to him doing his own research and purchasing it on a different platform. When asked, he affirms that he would have bought the product directly off of Facebook if he was able to get reputable information directly on the site. Considering this, social media platforms may need to add the option to provide fact-checked, reputable research sources to advertisements if they wish to appeal to older users. Wesley claimed that paid promotions from influencers have never been effective for reasons including lack of interest in the products they review, the influencers coming from largely different backgrounds and influencers having less expertise than the people who actually make the product. What I took from this is that we need influencers who are relatable to everyone and are experienced in a certain field. When asked if he would take the opportunity to be an ‘influencer’ and be paid to advertise other people’s products, he said he would be interested in showing off grocery and car products. I see this as an avenue to introduce new influencers that could have a much more effective, broader reach than current influencers


## **Interview #2 Report**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is a 22 year old woman who uses Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and WeChat. Her background was particularly intriguing to me considering her experience growing up in China and working in Marketing Analytics. She told me a lot about a platform called WeChat, which is super popular in China. She describes WeChat as an all encompassing social media app which allows you to message family, share moments with others, scroll through reels, send money, and find products/services. She recounted a story in which she bought some used clothes on the platform before and felt comfortable doing so since she speaks Chinese and is familiar with the Chinese market, unlike many. I believe there is a large opportunity to integrate products and services to existing platforms. In addition to her positive reviews on WeChat, she spoke very highly of both Instagram and Tiktok’s recommendation and search features which has allowed her to find places to eat and things to do in places she has moved to. Despite this however, she feels “the ads she gets does not accurately reflect the content she watches and searches for”. My takeaway is that a more transparent algorithm, where ad preferences are more explicitly expressed by users, would vastly empower social media users. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna views advertisements on social media as very useful, especially coming from someone working in Marketing Analytics, as it allows for companies to reach a broader group of people. From her expertise, the most effective form of advertising is “\[organic\] content that people share themselves, showing the product/experience in an authentic situation”. She finds both influencers and brands creating their own pages as effective ways companies can create a positive presence on social media, as long as their content is authentic. One company she follows on social media is Duolingo. She likes that the Duolingo mascot has become a meme and thinks the page does a great job in utilizing its mascot to tag in on trends and fit in more with a wide group of social media users. Considering the influencers and trends she mentioned mainly target younger groups, this affirmed my takeaway from my previous interview that companies need to do better at targeting all age groups. She responded well to the idea of playing the role of ‘influencer’ and reviewing products for commissions—she even told me about how some of her friends are influencers and she’s always dreamed of getting an opportunity to do this. Last, when asked about thoughts on built-in markets on social media platforms, she felt as though an application with a marketplace such as WeChat would be used by people worldwide, especially if the marketplace was reputable and sold quality products. 



## **Design Opportunity:**

- Prompting users to (optionally) provide interests and products they’re interested in once they create accounts so both their content and advertisements are relevant and catered to them
    
    - This feature would ensure that advertisements would better reflect the content users view, similar to what Anna wished many social media platforms did. Not only this, but it also gives more information for advertisers to use, allowing for them to better reach their target audiences.

- Implementing a feature which allows companies to offer deals/compensation for any users on the platform to review their products

    - I believe this implementation would result in more diversity in influencers, therefore creating a wider reach. In particular, both people I interviewed, despite being very different, were open to the opportunity to do this. A feature like this would allow for companies to reach broader audiences, and would allow for users to not only find, but obtain useful products.

- Creating a post promotion system that is accessible to all people, which allows for advertisers to select certain viewer profiles/attributes such as age, location, interests, profession, etc.

    - Wesley would be much more likely to use the paid promotion services on Facebook if he was given more insight into exactly how his content would be promoted. By creating this feature, the advertisement system on said social media platform would be a lot more transparent and would be much more accessible to those without a tech background. To be more precise, Wesley could use this tool as a small creator without a designated business account to target people who are interesed in specific car brands.

- Providing a freelance market on social media for verified professionals in a certain field to sign up and make product reviews for companies

    - Wesley stated that he would have bought shilajit directly off Facebook if he was given more reputable information. By allowing for companies to directly hire verified experts, users would not need to leave the platform to do their research, therefore making it much more likely that they would purchase from the brand who bought the ad. Additionally, this could help appeal to older age groups that are much less likely to purchase things online. Last, this content would be very organic, as Anna described, since the influencers in this case are experts.

- Implement a marketplace that both companies and consumers are able to upload verified products and services 
    - Would be similar to the description of WeChat which Anna mentioned, but would include a verification process which ensures cautious users like Wesley feel safe buying things from the platform. Verification could be done through reviews--to gain verification companies would need a certain number of reviews on a platform such as Yelp or Google Reviews.
