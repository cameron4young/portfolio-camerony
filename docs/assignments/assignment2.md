# Assignment 2

## Broad Application Goals
The name I came up with for my platform is **FindBuyReview**. The target audience is older generations--specifically people whom are not targeted by social media ads and do not fully understand/trust traditional social media apps. 

## Scrapbook of Comparables
<figure>
    <h4>Twitter</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image8.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption>Twitter interest survey which is given to new users when making an account: could we make something similar which is more closely related to products/services to build a user ad profile?
    </figcaption>

<figure>
    <h4>Tinder</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image5.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption>Tinder’s swipe feature: could this be repurposed to allow for users to swipe right and left on products/content they like? This could potentially be given to users when making accounts to tell which companies and products they like.
    </figcaption>

    <h4>Fiverr</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image4.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image10.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption> Fiverr, a freelance platform, has useful search and categorization features for finding freelancers: perhaps a similar format could be used for products/services on the user end, freelancer influencers on the company end?
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <h4>eBay</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image3.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption>eBay’s homepage has categorized carousels, relating to things the user has searched. Perhaps this could be an interesting way to present content—categorize things by product types and users can preview other’s reviews by hovering over the product thumbnail.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <h4>Amazon</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image12.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image7.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption>Amazon’s search page layout shows a lot of products at once, while still showing important details such as price, reviews, and delivery date. I plan to draw inspiration for this design for an ‘explore’/home page where products are shown off. Additionally, amazon’s individual product page could be utilized to build a similar page for products on FindBuyReview. One thing I would add is a grid-shaped video gallery so reviews are easily accessible and useful.

    <h4>Facebook Marketplace</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image2.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption>I particularly like Facebook marketplace’s sidebar which provides tools for users to act either as buyers or sellers on the same account: could we do something similar on an entire social media app—maybe a buyer/seller mode switch?
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <h4>TikTok</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image1.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption> TikTok does a particularly good job integrating the shop into its app by allowing creators to link products directly to their videos and lives: is there a way we could make the product listing button more obvious and informative?
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <h4>Etsy</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image11.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption> Etsy’s seller profile page helps make potential users feel better about buying products from certain stores: we could make company profiles with similar attributes to this, but also influencer profiles so that people and companies give more attention to trusted, successful reviewers
    </figcaption>

<figure>
    <h4>Handshake</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/image9.png" width="500" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <figcaption> User profiles can look similar to Handshake profiles, but instead show their interests, areas of expertise, and review experience.

## Brainstorming feature ideas ##
1. User profile survey \- An interest and advertisement preferences survey which is given to users when they first create their account. The survey will specifically be used to curate user’s feed and promotions.  
2. Accessible Post Promotion \- A post promotion system which allows for both users and brands to precisely select what users they wish to target. To be precise, advertisers will be able to choose from the information asked by the user interest survey to specifically target certain audiences.  
3. Brand swipe \- Users can preview a brand’s profile, and choose whether they want to see them in their feed by swiping. They would also be able to visit the company’s full profile or website.  
4. Product swipe \- Users swipe through products to help build their interest profile, and hopefully find a useful product while doing so. This can be leveraged to recommend better products to users  
5. Brand-User DMs \- Brands can reach out to subscribed users to offer discounts or deals for reviewing a product. After the user creates a review, the brand will receive the review in their DM so they can reimburse/compensate accordingly.  
6. Verified Reviews \- Companies can verify reviews and highlight them on the product page to help bolster their reputability.  
7. Review tutorials \- Tutorials on the platform that specifically aim to teach older generations how to record themselves and create content for companies. They can put certifications on their profiles to boost their chances at an offer/deal for a product.  
8. Buyer/reviewer profile \- Includes interests and demographics which help give more specific ads. Also allows for companies to use this data to find a more diverse group of influencers to make videos.  
9. Reviewer Portfolio \- A portfolio of completed reviews done by a user, so that companies can see previous work and friends of the user can ask that user more questions about the product (leveraging people’s personal relationships with others to gain trust in the product).  
10. Product Explore Page \- Users can browse through a specific category or keyword search result to find products. For example, users can browse through “Home” products by viewing products in a carousel, grid, or scrolling.  
11. Influencer freelance marketplace \- Allows for users on the platform to advertise themselves to companies as influencers. Gives ‘non-traditional’ influencers a platform for deals, a plus for both company and users.  
12. Brand Profiles \- Brand profiles are unique to users profiles, where they have more information on the products they sell, how many reviews they’ve gotten, and what types of deals they offer. Badges such as “High Reviews” or “Top Seller” can be added to profiles to give people more security in buying from brands on the platform.  
13. Product Verification \- Brands on the platform can send their product to 5 random users to make sure everything is shipped as expected and quality is up to par. If the users collectively agree the product is of good quality, the product would be verified.  
14. Products/Services Feed \- Users can scroll through a feed of products or services and choose from a wide range of reviews for each product. Reviews will be presented to the user with information on who is reviewing the product so users can have more reassurance.  
15. Already Have/Used Button \- On product or service ads, customers can click a button which tells the platform the user has already used the product or service being advertised. With this feature, ads will be less frequently shown to people that are familiar with the company, a plus for both consumer and company.  
16. Block Companies or Influencer Promotions \- A button on advertisements which allows for users to block companies or influencers they will not buy products from.  
17. Open Product and Service Marketplace \- A marketplace where both advertisers and users can post products and users can purchase things.  
18. Link Products to Posts \- A button would be added on reviews or advertisements that directly take users to the product listing in the marketplace. Additionally, liking the review would result in the post showing up in your feed more frequently. Last, an option to share the product (not just the post) would be available on the post.  
19. Bad Review Visibility \- Showing a certain number of bad reviews for every good review to ensure that companies can’t just flood their reviews with promotions.   
20. Affiliation Links \- Even if users are not paid or given a discount to review a product, they can still gain revenue through an affiliation link which takes users to the marketplace from their video.  
21. Yelp and Google Reviews compatibility \- Sellers can get their products or services verified through a number of positive reviews on other platforms such as Yelp and Google Reviews. This can also be put on seller’s pages to boost reputability.  
22. Wish Lists and Collections \- Users can create wish lists of products they don’t have and collections of products they already have. Both would have the option of being public or private, with public collections/lists having the ability to guide others in their search for a product.  
23. Products linked to Live Video- Users can go live and promote or auction off products they are selling in their stores. Users can also go live with brands or influencers to ask more questions about products.  
24. Local Product/Service Map \- Reviews can be tagged with a location, so that users can simultaneously find local products and services near them and learn more about them through a review.  
25. “Looking for” Status \- A status which users can set on their profile which designates they are currently looking for a specific product or service. Advertisers can specifically target people looking for their products, therefore making advertisements much more useful  

## VSD Analysis ##
1. **Direct stakeholders** may spend too much money if they are continuously shown advertisements for things they want to buy. A feature to help users limit their spending habits may be a spending limit set by each user, which prevents them from spending more money than their limit in a certain time frame. These spending limits can be automatically added to accounts to further minimize the risk of overspending.  
2. A **non-targeted use** would be for people to do reviews and get deals on products to resell them for more. This might call for a limit on how many reviews each person can do. Perhaps, review limits can be based upon how many followers the user has.   
3. Another **non-targeted use** would be for people to fake reviews and not put much effort into them, just to get the product discounts/offers. A moderation system could be implemented, where companies approve which reviews are deemed worthy of discounts or not. Another solution would be to give discounts based upon the quality of the review.  
4. In regards to **adaptation**, the application may lead to people shopping from home more often. This can be a negative lifestyle choice if it leads to compulsive buying, however the use of spending limits as previously mentioned can vastly limit the dangers of this happening. This can be a positive lifestyle choice if it leads to people saving more time than both shopping in person and shopping online (on other platforms). The platform may also empower users to find products that make their day-to-day life easier, which they would have never found had they never been on the application.  
5. **Work Of The Future**: Users are given the opportunity to earn discounts, get products for free, or even make money through affiliate link commissions —all just by reviewing products on the platform. FindBuyReview may open up the door for many professionals without a social media presence to start earning revenue through social media. For example, toothbrush brands may elect to hire dentists to create influencer style videos to build rapport with more skeptical crowds.  
6. **Political realities**: Since FindBuyReview will be both a social media app and an app where people buy and sell products/services, there are a lot of political factors which may limit or affect some user’s use. In democratic environments, users highly value transparency but dislike the idea of giving data to social media companies. This means that the platform must include clarifications on how data is being used, and how the algorithms behind advertising work. In an authoritarian environment such as Russia, people may not feel safe providing honest reviews or provide too much detail about themselves out of fear in regards to privacy and safety.  
7. **Value Tensions:** A more robust user profile may lead to more accurate advertisements, but less privacy. Allowing for profile visibility of any demographics on the app is important to ensure privacy is still intact. Additionally, it is important that when companies target demographics, they are never shown who they are individually advertising to.  
8. **Value Tensions:** Freelance reviewers doing too many reviews to make more money may lead to less reputable reviews. In order to fix this, we could limit the number of reviews and incentivize companies to vary their sponsorship deals such that users are paid based upon review quality.

## Storyboarding ##

    <h4>Storyboard #1: John creates a FindBuyReview profile and finds a useful dental product.</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/storyboard1.png" width="1000" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <p>Things that may be unclear: who gets shown to John if nobody matches his preferences, are promotions available to all users or is that idea infeasible?</p>
</figure>

<figure>
    <h4>Storyboard #2: John lists his car on the marketplace and promotes the post to target users like Jane -> Jane purchases the car</h4>
    <img src="/../assets/images/a2-images/storyboard2.png" width="1000" style="border-radius:2vh">
    <p>Things that may be unclear: if a user should purchase on the platform directly, how a user gains trust with a seller</p>
